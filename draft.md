        - Some kind of inspirational quote or something

I was volunteering for a crisis hotline on an especially slow night. But out of the blue, our once-empty queue filled with dozens of people due to a phone glitch. These people had been waiting nearly an hour to talk to someone, so our supervisors instructed us to prioritize short, high-risk conversations. I accepted a call from an older woman, let's call her Sarah, who had spent years in an abusive relationship and had reached her wits end.

As we talked, I filled out paperwork as usual, and my supervisor suggested Sarah should have in-person support. Sarah adamantly refused this, as she didn't want her husband to know she reached out. My supervisor insisted she was at imminent risk, and I should send a team anyway.

When I brought this up to Sarah, she was terrified. I stayed on the line and pretended to be a cable company while Sarah grabbed some cash, told her husband she was going grocery shopping, and fled to a shelter in another state. Sarah was able to stay safe that night, but I learned just how much harm active rescues can cause.

While many mental health professionals see active rescues as completely necessary, they can and do hurt our society's most vulnerable people.

When we call a crisis hotline, we trust that the counselor on the other end of the line will help us to the best of their abilities. We trust that they will listen to us and that they will respect our decisions. Policies found in training materials like the 988 Convening Playbook and the Crisis Text Line volunteer textbook are evidence-based and backed by years of research. Both resources suggest that empowering crisis counselors with more resources provides a better experience for them and for people in crisis. So why shouldn't we extend that trust to crisis workers when it comes to active rescues? After all, a crisis is not the time to be overly cautious, and some crises endanger entire families or communities.

Further, active rescues are shown to be effective when implemented appropriately. In a 2020 interview with Cache Valley Daily, a crisis worker claimed that sending a crisis team dropped hospitalization rates by 21 percent.

This belief is often called the medical model for mental healthcare. The idea is that the doctor (or in this case, the mental health worker) knows best. "Trust your doctor as you do your God" is a popular aphorism here. 

While we all trust our doctors, we've probably all had a doctor not listen to us before. My uncle told a doctor he was allergic to iodine, but the doctor ignored this and nearly killed him during a CT scan. Crisis workers are highly trained, but we're not even nearly as competent as medical professionals. So should we really have the flexibility to make decisions that could have long-term consequences for the people we're trying to help?

The medical model for mental healthcare strives to follow the Hippocratic Oath. While the Oath urges doctors to "benefit my patients according to my greatest ability and judgment", In Harvard Health Publishing, Robert Shmerling mentions the same Hippocrates who wrote the famed oath also coined the phrase "First, do no harm". While active rescues can be beneficial, we cannot ignore their enormous potential to harm people. 

Crisis workers have a sacred responsibility to avoid harming the people they support. Distrust regarding active rescues is keeping people in crisis off the phone, and distrust in general keeps people from seeking any kind of help. Crisis workers generally strive to follow the social work model for mental healthcare. Rather than imposing the idea of an all-knowing doctor, we include the person in crisis in as many decisions as possible, even about minute details. Even when someone is in a crisis, it is imperative to recognize people know a lot about their own situations, so we need to follow their wishes.

Prohibiting active rescues does not leave communities at risk. When we hear about a crisis in which people's lives are immediately in danger, especially if it goes beyond the person who calls, the 988 Convening Playbook requires us to smoothly transfer the call to a local 911 operator. 

In summary, while we ought to trust crisis workers and mental health professionals, it is important to recognize the harm an active rescue can cause. 

I believe active rescues should be prohibited. Only then will people feel confident reaching out for support.

(something inspirational but I don't have the emotional capacity for that right now)
